## Overview

The Estate Price Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to predict housing prices in Bangalore based on various features such as area type, location, size, and amenities. This project is suitable for those interested in data science, real estate analysis, and predictive modeling.

### Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of properties across different parameters.
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations to identify trends and relationships between features and prices.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict housing prices based on input features.

## Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hsu212/Estate-Price-Prediction.git
   cd estate_price_prediction
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure you have Python installed, then install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Load the Dataset**:
   Ensure that the `Bengaluru_House_Data.csv` file is in the same directory as your notebook. You can load the dataset with the following code:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("Bengaluru_House_Data.csv")
   ```

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Estate_price_prediction.ipynb`) and execute the cells to perform data analysis and visualize the results.

5. **Explore the Results**:
   Analyze the output and visualizations generated to gain insights into the Bangalore housing market.
